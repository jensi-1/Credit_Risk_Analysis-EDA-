# Credit_Risk_Analysis-EDA-
 In-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a credit risk dataset to identify key patterns, trends, and potential risk factors affecting loan approvals and defaults.
Credit Risk Analysis using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing credit risk using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. The goal is to uncover key patterns, trends, and risk factors that influence loan approvals and defaults. By leveraging Python and data visualization tools, we gain insights into customer creditworthiness and financial stability.

Objective
Identify factors affecting loan defaults and approvals.
Analyze borrower attributes such as income, credit score, loan amount, and repayment history.
Visualize trends and correlations using statistical methods.
Provide data-driven insights for credit risk management.
Dataset
The dataset consists of historical credit transactions, including borrower information, loan details, and default status. It includes features such as:

Loan Amount
Annual Income
Credit Score
Employment Status
Debt-to-Income Ratio
Loan Status (Default/No Default)
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Key Steps in Analysis
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handling missing values and outliers
Feature engineering for better insights
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
Distribution of loan amounts and credit scores
Correlation analysis between financial factors and loan defaults
Visualization & Insights

Heatmaps, histograms, box plots, and bar charts
Trend analysis of loan approvals and defaults
Results & Findings
High debt-to-income ratio increases the risk of default.
Borrowers with low credit scores have a higher probability of loan rejection.
Loan amount and income play a crucial role in credit risk assessment.

Conclusion
This project provides a detailed understanding of credit risk through data-driven analysis. The findings help financial institutions improve their risk assessment strategies and make informed lending decisions.
